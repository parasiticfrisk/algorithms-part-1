## Course Description:
This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

All the features of this course are available for free.  It does not offer a certificate upon completion.

| [Percolation]                  | Write a program to estimate the value of the <i>percolation threshold</i> via Monte Carlo Simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [view specifications][spec01] |
| [Deques and Randomized Queues] | Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce generics and iterators.                                                                                                                                | [view specifictaions][spec02] |
| [Collinear Points]             | Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [view specifications][spec03] |
| [8 Puzzle]                     | Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [view specifications][spec04] |
| [Kd-Trees]                     | Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a </i>2d-tree</i> to support efficient <i>range search</i> (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and <i>nearest-neighbor search</i> (find a closest point to a query point). | [view specifications][spec05] |
